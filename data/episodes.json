    "description": "In this episode of Scott and Mark Learn To, Scott Hanselman and Mark Russinovich discuss innovative tools they built with AI assistance: Mark’s smart directory navigation tool that streamlines moving through nested folders by typing partial names, and Scott’s study website that transforms complex topics into structured, digestible material with AI-generated answers and progress tracking. They explore the challenges of AI “hallucination,” where models invent detailed but fictional information, and share insights on computer science history, including Leslie Lamport’s contributions. Their conversation also touches on evolving UI design trends from minimalist styles to flashy effects like “liquid glass” and debates the balance between aesthetics, usability, and energy efficiency in modern technology. \n\nListen to other episodes at https://scottandmarklearn.to     \n\nDiscover other Microsoft podcasts at https://microsoft.com/podcasts    \n\n\nCode: 5Q6MBEQYU7GRVDVG",

Mark Russinovich opens up about how he experiences stress when his schedule gets out of control, and both hosts discuss the importance of mindfulness, exercise, having work besties, and managing social energy. The episode is packed with practical tips, vulnerable moments, and reflections on what it really takes to perform at a high level, whether it’s on stage, at work, or in life.  \n\nListen to other episodes at https://scottandmarklearn.to     \n\nDiscover other Microsoft podcasts at https://microsoft.com/podcasts    \n\n\nCode: KZMAP1HVIOK2NEQQ",

They explore the difference between constructive critique and personal opinion, the impact of timing and context, and how motivation behind feedback can shape how it's received. Sharing real stories about presentation flops, speaker coaching, and surprising reactions to their ideas, they reflect on how experience builds resilience and why it’s important to hold onto your convictions while staying open to growth. They also touch on the balance between instinct and data in decision-making, the subtle politics of corporate resistance, and even the fine art of surviving massive Zoom meetings with 81 attendees. It’s an honest, funny, and thoughtful conversation about learning, evolving, and breathing through it all. \n\nListen to other episodes at https://scottandmarklearn.to     \n\nDiscover other Microsoft podcasts at https://microsoft.com/podcasts    \n\n\nCode: VUWQXEZ8UUCEYRN9",

    "description": "In this episode of Scott and Mark Learn To, Scott Hanselman and Mark Russinovich discuss using AI to build a fractal shader in just 15 minutes—something that would normally take hours of manual coding. They explore the challenges and limitations of AI in real-world projects, particularly with large, complex codebases. The conversation covers the importance of understanding licensing and tools like GitHub Copilot for sourcing and attributing code. Mark shares his experiences with AI-assisted coding, particularly the frustrations of models that \"fix\" issues but miss the mark. They highlight how AI struggles with complex projects, maintaining state, and adapting to evolving requirements. Ultimately, they agree that while AI can assist with certain tasks, human expertise is essential for ensuring the right context and specification in development. \n\n\nListen to other episodes at https://scottandmarklearn.to     \n\nDiscover other Microsoft podcasts at https://microsoft.com/podcasts   \n\n\nCode: VUWQXEZ8UUCEYRN9",

They discussed how systems thinking approach contrasts with traditional code practices. They also explored the challenges of integrating AI into coding, the limitations of AI-generated code, the necessity of understanding the broader system in which code operates and debated the balance between deep analysis and decisive action. \n\nListen to other episodes at https://scottandmarklearn.to   \n\nDiscover other Microsoft podcasts at https://microsoft.com/podcasts   \n\n \nCode: YBTV1CWFHX9ENPTY",

    "description": "In this episode of Scott and Mark Learn To, Scott Hanselman and Mark Russinovich explore the evolution of cloud computing, tracing its roots from the early days of Azure to its transformation into a powerful, flexible platform. Mark explains the shift from \"pets\" (individual servers) to \"cattle\" (easily replaceable servers) as cloud infrastructure became more scalable and cost-efficient. They discuss the challenges of scaling websites, from physical data centers to cloud-based solutions, and the economic and technical factors that led to the rise of multi-tenancy and on-demand services. The episode also highlights Azure’s adoption of Linux and the broader embrace of open-source technologies, marking a key shift in Microsoft’s cloud strategy. The conversation reflects on how modern cloud services abstract away complex infrastructure management, much like the simplification seen in programming languages with garbage collection. \n\nThe Mind Behind Windows: Dave Cutler: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xi1Lq79mLeE \n\nMicrosoft Volume I: The Complete History and Strategy of founding through Windows 95 (Audio): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycI_xXjpElY \n\nMicrosoft Volume II: The Complete History and Strategy of the Ballmer Years (Audio): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oER1bdQa_s \n\nListen to other episodes at https://scottandmarklearn.to   \n\nDiscover other Microsoft podcasts at https://microsoft.com/podcasts   \n\n\nCode: IAY5IVDT9GDYWQSZ",

    "description": "In this episode of Scott & Mark Learn To, Scott Hanselman and Mark Russinovich dive into the quirks and philosophies of programming languages—debating the purpose of small languages, like Erlang, versus giants like JavaScript. Along the way, they discuss whether modern languages with hindsight (like Kotlin) are inherently better and reminisce about the good old days of writing code in C, Delphi, and even 6502 assembler. Mark reflects on transitioning to Rust for system-level code in Azure, marking a deliberate move away from C/C++. He highlights Rust’s ownership model, memory safety, and enforced concurrency as the game-changers. Meanwhile, Scott is poking fun at the oddities of language trends, including Python’s rise to dominance in machine learning.   \n\nListen to other episodes at https://scottandmarklearn.to  \n\nDiscover other Microsoft podcasts at https://microsoft.com/podcasts   \n\n\nCode: LDEQICH6FI4STFJY",

    "description": "In this episode of Scott & Mark Learn To, Scott Hanselman and Mark Russinovich explore the evolving role of AI in tech, from leveraging tools like GitHub Copilot to boost productivity in coding, to the potential pitfalls of over-reliance on AI. They discuss how AI is reshaping both education and professional development and reflect on the challenges of large language models (LLMs), including issues like hallucinations, indirect prompt injection attacks, and jailbreaks. Mark highlights how models, shaped by Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF), can still produce unpredictable results, underscoring the need for transparency, safety, and ethical use in AI-driven systems.  \n \nListen to other episodes at https://scottandmarklearn.to  \n\nDiscover other Microsoft podcasts at https://microsoft.com/podcasts  \n\n\nCode: PSZFWJA6TFDECU3K",

    "description": "In this episode of Scott & Mark Learn To, Scott Hanselman and Mark Russinovich discuss the concept of shipping the org chart, a term used to describe when different teams' outputs are inconsistently integrated, reflecting the organizational structure rather than a cohesive product. Scott recounts his experience test-driving an electric vehicle with a disjointed interface, which made him question the internal coordination within the automaker. Mark explains how Microsoft addresses this issue through standardization and tooling, emphasizing the need for consistent APIs and user experiences. They also debate the balance between maintaining consistency and fostering innovation, and how large tech companies like Microsoft and Apple manage these challenges.  \n\nListen to other episodes at https://scottandmarklearn.to \n\nDiscover other Microsoft podcasts at https://microsoft.com/podcasts \n\n\nCode: ZCNTOBBGIRBPX9CQ",
